# secure-refurb
A Python tool used for checking Linux computer readiness and generating system reports.

## Current features

- Displays operating system, processor architecture, and Python version.
- Checks available disk space against a configurable threshold.
- Saves system information and disk-space result to 'report.json'.

## Running the tool

Requires Python 3.10 or newer. No additional packages are necessary.

```bash
python3 secure_refurb.py
```

The report is saved in the current working directory. Each run replaces the previous report.

## Project status

Early prototype, tested on MacOS with Apple Silicon. Ubuntu support and additional readiness checks are planned.

Note, the current 20 GiB disk-space threshold is for demonstration reasons, not as an offical system requirement.
